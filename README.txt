mvcrs is the folder containing the MVC web app.
rsapi is the folder containing the WEBAPI project.

In the rsapi,
we have created a SongController which is returning the Song lyrics based on the request.
In the Song.cs we have 2 ways to return the lyrics, One is to store the lyrical text in variable and return it and other is directly return the string from read file.

And in the mvcrs, 
we are reading the response from the server and setting up with the response in between div with the given IDs.
